## Synopsis

Originally inspired by the challenges of Alzheimer, this storybook style story is one of a family reminiscing on the joy of playing together. Imagining themselves as Knights, Grampa and Grandma solve the puzzles of the dungeon, describing its perils to their grandchild.

As an online collaborative game, every room requires both players to communicate with each other so as to reveal the path through the many obstacles. Paying attention to each other is key, as players will soon realise that what is visible to one is not necessarily so for the other. Thus, it is only through communication and collaboration that the family will open the doors.
