Warning: Effects on Auxiliary Busses will no longer ignore dry levels. Effects that used to ignore dry levels had their dry levels muted by the migration if they were placed on Auxiliary Busses to keep the project's previous behavior. There may be differences in behavior if the same Effect is applied to an Auxiliary Bus and another object. Please refer to the migration notes for more information.
